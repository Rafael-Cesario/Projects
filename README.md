# Projects

This repository is where a save my small projects focused on something specific, these projects are like my notes and my way to learn.
Building something is my way to learn, this way I can test things and solve common problems that may happen.

I separate my projects in three folders: frontend, backend, and css.
Each project should have his own readme to explain the project.
